# ShareScripts
Purpose is keystroke saving, and not having to remember arcane syntax.
Functions done by the files in this respository are as follows:
chdp: To change permissions on a directory
chfp: To change permissions on specific files
conv1: To convert a stereo file to a mono file (due to Audacity 
  sometimes exporting a mono track to stereo)
dfs: To list disk free space of only actual /dev devices plus total
dp: To move the latest file in Downloads to the current directory
findf: To find files by partial filename (case insensitive, 
  flexible arguments)
fixfil: To take extra non-universal characters from filenames
  (different from convmv and supplemental to it)
getblk: To get block device UUIDs and their mount points
getip: To get current WAN IP address, and save to file for future reference
lfl: List Files only, no directories (and remove long form clutter)
ldl: List Directories only, no files (and remove long form clutter)
lnks: List links in current directory (and remove long form clutter)
psx: To show process without clutter or extra typing (only argument needed 
  is process name or number)
